# Alley Rat

**Points**: 6 Intellect points
**Type**: Action

While in a city, you find or create a significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the situation.

You and the GM should work out the details.
